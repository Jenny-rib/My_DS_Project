    <h1>üéµ TikTok Track Popularity Prediction: Agile-Based Data Product Development</h1>
    <h3>
      This project integrates machine learning, agile development, and CI/CD to build a TikTok track popularity prediction system based on audio features. Users can input song characteristics via a web app to receive predicted popularity scores. The project followed a Scrum-based workflow covering data processing, modeling, frontend development, and automated deployment, resulting in a functional and engineering-complete interactive product prototype.
